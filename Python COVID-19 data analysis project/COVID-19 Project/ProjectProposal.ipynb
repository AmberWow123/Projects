    "# Background & Prior Work\n",
    "- One of the main reasons that we wanted to work on this topic is because it is so relevant. This pandemic is affecting many lives around the world, and it seems as though the tragedies from it have yet to be over. We want to learn about how air travel could have affected the states around us and how it could possibly continue to affect them. We believe that air travel may have been a factor in the disease spreading so quickly. We would like to know if the amount of flights coupled with the conditions in the plane may have made it very easy for this disease to spread from person to person. This is important because, while this seems like something that at some point was unimaginable, the conditions in place at airports and flights may have allowed many more people to become infected. \n",
    "- What we currently know from the news is that the pandemic originated from Wuhan, China around November 2019. Everyone went into isolation in China, but many people did not believe that the disease would spread in the way that it did. The disease mutates very quickly, which makes it difficult to even begin to create a vaccine. There is a large amount of research going on to find a vaccine, and there is a lot of information about the growing numbers of infected around the world. \n",
    "- According to the National Public Radio, since the first diagnosed case in Jan 21, half a million people have tested positive for COVID-19. The US has become the nation with the most deaths due to this epidemic. Along with this information, NPR also has charts with the evolution of the disease, by state, along with the number of cases and deaths for each state. (website: https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/16/816707182/map-tracking-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus-in-the-u-s) \n",
    "- According to James Booth from DMARGE.com, people should be avoiding air travel during this time. This editor has compared the statistics of COVID cases, as well as the statistics about air travel during this time and found a pattern. Much like we believe, the more COVID 19 cases that an area had, the more flights that had gone to that particular place. The author urges people to stay home and be wary of travel.

    "# Hypothesis\n",
    "- We hypothesize that states with more incoming flights will have a higher concentration of COVID-19 cases or patients, since COVID-19 originated from Wuhan, China, and symptomatic and asymptomatic patients might have entered the particular state through a flight from overseas. \n",
    "- We also hypothesize that states with more incoming flights from countries with a higher amount of COVID-19 cases are more likely to have a higher concentration of COVID-19 cases in that state as well.\n",
    "- We hypothesize that incoming flights with a larger number of passengers could contribute to a higher amount of COVID-19 cases in that state."

    "# Ethics & Privacy\n",
    "This research question may provoke some ethical concerns. As we have seen through the media, due to its coverage in every news feed, the topic of COVID-19 may create some negative attitudes towards Chinese individuals, as well as towards more privileged people who have easier access to testing. While this could be the case, we hope to bring more awareness towards how COVID-19 is spread rather than blaming individuals. This topic will focus on how the disease could be transmitted through travel (specifically air travel), not towards the harming of any individuals mentally or physically. Privacy would not be a large concern because we are not looking at demographics of certain individuals or looking into specific information about them. The data obtained for this research question will be from a large cohort that will make it almost impossible to trace back to specific individuals. \n"
